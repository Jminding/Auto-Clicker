# Auto-Clicker
I made this auto-clicker for people who don't want to deal with complicated stuff.
Disclaimer: It does not come with a GUI, simply just edit the code to make it work.

# How to install and use
1. Download a code editor or IDE that runs [Python](https://www.python.org).
2. After setting up your code editor or IDE, navigate to your terminal.  Then, enter the following commands (one after the other): `pip install pynput` and `pip install threading`.
3. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/Jminding/autoclicker/releases) tab and download `Auto.Clicker.py` and `Auto.Keyboard.Button.Presser.py`.  Those are the two "Applications" that are the auto-clickers.
4. You will have to give the code permission to control the computer - so navigate to your system settings and enable the code editor or IDE to control your computer.
5. And you're done!  Edit the code to your liking and controls.

### Disclaimer
Some of this code comes from an online tutorial, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eamTeszpeZ4).
